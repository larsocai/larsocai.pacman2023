<strong>PacMan Project | MIT xPro: Professionial Certificate in Coding</strong>

<p>This project takes PNG images of a classic PacMan and uses JavaScript to make it come to life. With its onclick feature (found in the HTML file), you can start PacMan chomping across the screen.</p>

<p>Within the JavaScript file, there are two functions, an array, and the method setTimeout.</p>
